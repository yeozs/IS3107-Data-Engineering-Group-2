Singapore’s public housing system, HDB, provides accommodations for about 85% of Singapore’s population (Lim, 2024). The buying and selling of a HDB flat is not just a significant financial decision. It is often one of the most meaningful milestones in a person’s life (Lim, 2024). This is especially true in the resale sector, where flats are subject to fluctuating market conditions and pricing (Durai and Wang, 2023). Resale stakeholders must carefully evaluate their financial readiness amidst change and uncertainties. This project provides a comprehensive prediction model for Singapore HDB resale flat prices, leveraging historical pricing data alongside economic and geographical variables. Modelling techniques utilised include ARIMA, Linear Regression and XGBoost.

Project deliverables include:
1) A Google Looker dashboard that provides real-time insights on historical and predicted future HDB flats prices
2) A Streamlit interface utilising machine-learning models to predict resale prices based on historical (Linear Regression) and future (XGBoost) market trends
